                                JVOIPLIB ChangeLog

                                    -----------


 1.4.1 (October 2005)
 	* Some debug information was sent to stdout in the previous
	  release. This is now fixed.

 1.4.0 (October 2005)
 	* Added simple Speex compression component. Currently, only
	  a 20 ms sampling interval and 8000 Hz sampling rate are
	  supported.
	* Fixed small bug in jvoiprtptransmission.cpp: the mcastIPs list
	  was not updated in the JoinMulticastGroup call.
	* Configure script was adjusted. Now, you can use --disable-X
	  to exclude certain components from the library.
	* Added file input and output components using libsndfile.

 1.3.0 (September 2004)
 	* Now using JThread 1.1.0
	* Now using JRTPLIB 3.x.x
 	* Added possibility to exclude components from the library. This
	  way, a light-weight version of the library can easily be created.
	  To disable a component, adjust a line in jvoipconfig.h in the
	  'src' subdirectory.
	* Solved the '100%' cpu time problem in the MS-Windows version.

 1.2.0 (February 2002)
 	* IMPORTANT CHANGE: As of now, it is illegal to call the
	  JVOIPSession destructor while the session is still active.
	  The 'Destroy' method must be called prior to the destructor.
	  Thanks to David Allouche for pointing out the problem in
	  the previous versions.
	* Made improvements to the soundcard IO modules (on both
	  windows and Linux platforms).
	* Fixed some bugs which could cause the session to hang...
	* Added a configure script for the Qt version of the test utility.
	* Changed the makefile so that the manual isn't compiled 
	  automatically. A precompiled manual will be included in the
	  source code archive.

 1.1.1 (July 2001)
 	* Minor changes: the latest MS Visual Studio service pack,
	  caused some problems with winsock. Made some adjustments to
	  work around it.
				   
 1.1.0 (June 2001)
 	* Modified 3D localisation interface.
	* Added HRTF based localisation module
	* Made the VoiceBlock more extensible: added a way to allow other
	  components to pass information between them (by adding info to
	  the VoiceBlock instance)
	* Removed the JThread and JMutex module from the library package.
	  Now, these things are put in their own library.
	* Changed the interface of the transmission module: now the sample
	  interval is also passed as a parameter in the Init function.
	* Fixed bug in JVOIPSession which could cause the session to wait
	  for a signal that would never come.
	* Fixed bug in JVOIPSessionParams: forgot to copy several fields
	  in the assignment operator and the copy constructor.
	* Added mu-law encoding as a compression module.
	* Added LPC 5.4kbps compression module. This implementation is
	  based upon the LPC implementation of Ron Frederick.
	* Added GSM 06.10 compression module, based upon the implementation
	  by Jutta Degener and Carsten Bormann.
	* Fixed some bugs in JVOIPCompression: forgot to do some actions
	  when some functions returned an error.
	* Improved synchronization in the RTP transmission module.
	* Added a nice test utility for the library (in Qt and MFC). 
	* Fixed bug in Win32 soundcard output module.

 1.0.0 (December 2000)
 	* First official release of jvoiplib.
